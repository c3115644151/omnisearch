# What is OmniSearch?

Playing a large modpack often means having a browser window open right next to your game. Checking a recipe, understanding a new machine, or identifying a mysterious creature constantly forces you to break your immersion by alt-tabbing to an external wiki.

OmniSearch is designed to solve this fundamental problem. It is a lightweight, client-side mod that seamlessly integrates the vast knowledge base of MC百科 (mcmod.cn) directly into the Minecraft client. It allows you to search for and read richly formatted wiki articles without ever leaving your game window, keeping your focus where it belongs: on your adventure.

# How to Use

**Hover & Long-Press:** Hover your cursor over an item and long-press the **'TAB' key** to instantly search for it.

**Press the Hotkey:** You can also press the **'TAB' key** (configurable in controls) at any time to open the search screen and manually type in what you're looking for.

**Browse & Read:** A list of results will appear. Click on any entry to view its detailed wiki page, complete with images, icons, and clickable links. You can use the **Back button** to navigate, just like in a browser.

# Core Features
*   **Directly In-Game:** No more leaving the game window. Everything happens right inside Minecraft.
*   **Rich Content:** Thanks to a custom-built renderer, you see the wiki pages just as they are, with full formatting.
*   **Smart & Simple:** Supports history, multiple results, and is designed to be as intuitive as possible.

# Important Notes

*   **[!] Experimental Stage:** Please be aware that OmniSearch is a brand new mod. While functional, you may still encounter some bugs or rendering issues.
*   **[!] Feedback is Welcome:** If you find any issues, please report them on our GitHub Issues Page. Your feedback is invaluable!
*   **[!] Recommended Font:** For the best visual experience, we highly recommend using the ModernUI mod for improved font rendering.
